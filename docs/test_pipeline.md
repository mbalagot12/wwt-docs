# CI/CD Pipeline Test Page

This is a **temporary test page** to verify that the CI/CD pipeline triggers correctly when content changes are made.

## Test Information

- **Created**: $(date)
- **Purpose**: Verify CI/CD pipeline functionality
- **Status**: This file will be removed after testing
- **Version Protection**: This test does NOT affect the existing 2025.1.STL version

## How This Test Works

1. **Content Change Detection**: Adding this file tests that the pipeline detects new content
2. **Build Process**: Tests that MkDocs can build with the new content
3. **Version Isolation**: Creates a separate test version, leaving 2025.1.STL untouched
4. **Safe Testing**: Uses dry-run capabilities to test without deployment

## Test Results

If you can see this page in a deployed test version, the CI/CD pipeline is working correctly!

## Important Notes

- ✅ **Your 2025.1.STL version is protected** and will not be modified
- ✅ **Test versions are separate** and can be safely deleted
- ✅ **Dry-run testing** allows verification without actual deployment
- ✅ **Content changes trigger** the pipeline as expected

## Next Steps

After testing is complete:

1. This test file will be removed
2. Your 2025.1.STL version remains unchanged
3. The CI/CD pipeline is ready for production use
4. You can safely make real content changes

**Note**: This is a temporary test file and will be removed after CI/CD pipeline testing is complete.
