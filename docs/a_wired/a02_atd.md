# A-02-ATD | Provisioning a Campus Fabric - Virtual Lab

## Overview

In this lab you will be using Arista Test Drive (ATD) to simulate a campus leaf switch using CloudVision Studios, adding your new campus leaf switch to an existing Campus Fabric using Arista's Test Drive (ATD) virtual lab environment.

ATD provides a fully virtualized network topology that mirrors real-world campus deployments, allowing you to experience Arista's campus solutions without physical hardware. Your virtual environment includes:

- **Pre-configured Campus Infrastructure**: Virtual spine switches acting as your campus core
- **Virtual Leaf Switches**: Simulated campus access switches already onboarded with CloudVision
- **CloudVision Integration**: Full access to CloudVision Studios for fabric management
- **Realistic Network Scenarios**: Experience the same workflows you'd use in production

Your environment has been pre-configured with a sample Campus to assist with these new concepts. Studios is equipped with flexible constructs that give you the ability to describe your campus footprint. These will be common throughout this workshop:

## ATD Lab Access
